    # Approach
    # This one didn't go as I expected in the first sight.
    # The basic premise for this problem is that,
    # if two messages by different senders had same unread_count,
    # those two senders have read each other's message.
    # Because, if someone else read message, those two unread count will differ.
    # Understanding this flow is the key of this problem.

    # 1. For the specific message p,
    #   people who send messages after p are considered to read p
    # 2. For each person in the chat,
    #   if a person sent a message, and its unread_count is same as p's,
    #   they have read each other's message
    # 3. So, the logic goes
    #       iterating over people:
    #           for sender, unread_count in messages:
    #               if unread_count < p_unread_count:
    #                   someone else read that message, cannot guarantee the sender read p
    #               else:
    #                   no one else have read that message, can guarantee the sender read p
    # 4. If p's unread_count is 0, all the people have read that.

        sender, unread_count = input().split()
